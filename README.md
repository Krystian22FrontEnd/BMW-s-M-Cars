This page is all about BMW's famous M cars. There is a bit of orign story of how these cars where made,  in what circumstances, by who and why.
I have put here all generations of BMW's famous M cars, with their even more powerfull versions. At the bottom of the page, I put a table with all the basic information for basic M cars like: power, time from 0-100 km/h and more. Hope you enjoy it.
